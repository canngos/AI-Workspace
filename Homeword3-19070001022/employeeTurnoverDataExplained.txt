EMPLOYEE TURNOVER dataset

This Employee Turnover dataset is a real dataset shared from Edward Babushkin's blog used to predict an Employee's risk of quitting (with a Survival Analysis Model). Edward Babushkin explained that "Survival Analysis is one of the most importance but it's not the most popular algorithm to predict employee turnover. Analysts use more familiar algorithms like Logistic Regression but, for example, Pasha Roberts writes: 'Don't use logistic methods to predict attrition!'. I think that we can only apply for a short-term situation like whether the employee has worked more or less than three months. If our goal is to predict individual quitting risks, then the best method is Survival Analysis."
